// Lets understand the input and expected output
// Input is a word and expected is to find the first character that is not repeated.
// First create a string variable(nonRepeatChar) and assign it to empty string
// Assign the first character of the word to nonRepeatChar
// Loop through that word with i = 1, till the length of the word
// See if first character of the word is not equal to word[i], assign it to nonRepeatChar variable if it is
// return that variable(nonRepeatChar)
// if not assign word[i] to nonRepeatChar variable and repeat this step
// return that variable(nonRepeatChar)
