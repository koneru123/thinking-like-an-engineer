//sumNestedArray(arr);
//const arr = [[12,12],[6,6]];
//sumNestedArray(arr); //  [24, 12]

// Here since the input and output are not clear, had to get them clarified first
// Expected is an array, so lets create a sumArray and assign it to [].
// loop through the outer array first which in this case would be [[12,12],[6,6]]
// then loop through the individual inner array's in this case it would be [12,12] and [6,6]
// then loop through the array [12,12] based on the length and sum up the individual array elements
// then keep pushing the sum to the sumArray, once done
//return the sumArray
